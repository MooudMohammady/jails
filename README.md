# JS in Jails : A fun project for making an MVC framework in JavaScript

## What is Jails?

I always felt I missed how to code in JS and also, I always lacked a good understanding of software engineering. So I have decided to come up with this project. I try to recreate what I know from years of coding in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) on this _fun_ project. 

## TODO List

- [ ] Add a base HTML for templates/views
- [ ] Command line tool to generate models and migrations
